## 📋 Project Overview

The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

### Game Objective:

* Eat as much food as possible to increase your score.
* Control the snake's direction using keyboard keys.
* Avoid crashing into walls or your own body — or it's game over!

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Smooth Gameplay:** Responsive snake movement.
* **Dynamic Growth:** Snake grows longer as it eats food.
* **Score Tracking:** Displays current score during gameplay.
* **Collision Detection:** Game ends on hitting the wall or itself.
* **Keyboard Controls:** Intuitive controls using W, A, S, D keys.
* **Modular Code Structure:** Well-organized and easy to extend.

---


### 🛠️ Language & Libraries

* **Python 3.7+**
* **Turtle** (Python’s built-in graphics library)

### Dependencies

* No external libraries required — works with built-in Python modules.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Turtle module installed (included by default with Python)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Preetam/Snake_Game_Python.git
   cd Snake_Game_Python
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Run the Game**

   ```bash
   cd game
   python main.py
   ```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**

   Run `main.py` to launch the game window.

2. **Control the Snake**

   * **W** → Move Up
   * **A** → Move Left
   * **S** → Move Down
   * **D** → Move Right

3. **Gameplay Rules**

   * Eat food to grow the snake and increase your score.
   * Avoid crashing into walls or your own body.
   * The game ends when a collision occurs.

---

## 🧮 Concepts Demonstrated

* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes used for Snake, Food, and Scoreboard.
* **Modular Code Design:** Organized project structure for scalability.
* **Event Handling:** Keyboard inputs to control game actions.
* **Collision Detection:** Logic to detect and handle game-ending conditions.
* **Simple Game Development:** Use of Turtle graphics for animation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue                     | Solution                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Game window does not open | Verify Python and Turtle installation.                       |
| Controls not responding   | Ensure game window is focused.                               |
| Turtle module not found   | Make sure you're using standard Python, not a minimal build. |
