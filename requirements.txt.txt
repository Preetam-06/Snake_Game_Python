# Turtle module is built-in on most platforms.
# This line ensures compatibility for Windows users.
turtle ; platform_system == "Windows"

# ðŸ“Œ Notes:
# - Turtle comes with standard Python on Windows/macOS.
# - On Linux, you might need to install it manually:
#     sudo apt install python3-tk
# - turtle is not available on PyPI, so pip might skip it.
#   That's okay â€” it's expected!
